# Manifest: Techno-Arcane Wasteland

A single-player real-time strategy game built with Three.js featuring a techno-magical post-apocalyptic setting where you lead a specialized expedition team through the dangerous wasteland to discover ancient artifacts.

Note on sound at http://ieve.me/manifest ... it actually works in the game, although I should compress these WAV files into something not so huge. But I lost the battle against nginx, who just... will not serve the dang wav files.

## About the Game

In Manifest, you command a small squad of specialized units including a precision Neon Assassin sniper and a resilient Scrap Golem as they navigate through a desolate techno-arcane wasteland. Your mission is to reach and secure ancient beacons while avoiding or confronting hostile forces that guard this forgotten realm.

The game code was 99+% generated by LLM AI's in Mar 2025, mostly Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude Code, Gemini Thinking 2.0, and Manus (which I think is just using Claude underneath?)
I, the human, integrated the generated code in, complained about bugs, and felt very helpless while I let Claude Code chooch on a 'vibe-specification' (that is, a specification that was also 'vibe coded').

Game was written for the [2025 Vibe Game Jam](https://jam.pieter.com)

### Key Gameplay Features

- **Tactical Combat**: Command specialized units with unique abilities like the Neon Assassin's precision sniping
- **Dynamic Fog of War**: Explore and reveal the mysterious wasteland as you progress
- **One single semi-janky but technically working mission**: Alright I gotta go to work now...

## Project Architecture

The game is built with a modern, component-based architecture:

### Entity Component System (ECS)

- **Entities** are just IDs in the game world
- **Components** are pure data structures attached to entities (position, health, faction, etc.)
- **Systems** contain game logic that operates on entities with specific components
