# Vibecoding Game Jam - Development Timeline

| Time | Progress & Notes |
|------|------------------|
| **Saturday, 4:00 AM** | "Hello spinning box world! Hm, maybe some kind of basic RTS? Maybe some kind of _not basic_ RTS? Going to use three.js as recommended. Prooooobably going to shoot for something single player first." |
| **4:34 AM** | "We have a basic understanding of how to structure code to extend the basic parts of three.js. But you know who has a better understanding? My LLM council :)" <br><br> "Collaborated with Gemini to come up with a template structure and... I don't know, he wrote some other stuff in there about Entity Component System I didn't feel like reading. Shoved that in a CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS file and let Claude Code rip." |
| **5:13 AM** | "Spent 15 minutes with server trying to load /index.html, but my entrypoint being in /public/index.html. But nowwwww. We have... uh... a plane in a viewport with a couple of squares on it that looks like it could be the beginnings of an RTS game." |
| **5:39 AM** | "This looks like a lot of new information. Lets just make more coffee and vibe? Claude 3.7 with Github is funny. I was just asking the question like, 'How do I get from here to camera panning like Starcraft?' and he just updates everything, and adds unit selection while he's at it." |
| **6:33 AM** | "We have map panning (slowly, jankily) and unit selection (doesn't feel terrible at all), and unit movement but no collision, with a much larger viewspace and some generated junk (rocks and stuff) in the playfield." |
| **7:15 AM** | "More coffee, noodling on what the core loop should be." <br><br> Game concept notes: <br> - Pre-battle squad configuration with 10-ish upgradable units <br> - Battle selection level with map tiles/scenarios <br> - Battle scenarios focused on micromanagement with no building/resource gathering |
| **8:30 AM** | "Implementing unit test suites for everything implemented so far." |
| **9:00 AM** | "OK, we have some kind of a template framework that could become an RTS, and some vague idea of how the game should play by mashing together games from my childhood." |
| **10:00 PM** | "The 85% thing is real. Well I'm not quite at 85%, but, the general idea that like you're vibing and things are coming together so much more quickly than you could ever have imagined... But then I tried to do too much at once, and I let the LLMs loose with all the code and the testing, and I'm not really a software guy so I can't see at a glance whether the tests are bullshit. And then it turns out the tests were bullshit, and the LLM was adding test-specific code to the business logic to get the tests to pass." |
| **10:30 PM** | "The tests are passing. I was annoyed but... tbh like, there are thousands of lines of code and tests here and most of them are pretty correct so... I shouldn't complain too much. Working through some runtime errors." |
| **11:00 PM** | "It still looks like it could become a game. Somewhere early along the way I gave the guidance 'starcraft-like', and so *somebody* added resource system, production system, made it minerals/gas and threw some starcraft units in there :)" |
| **11:38 PM** | "I think we're out, finally. Got Claude to refactor the entrypoint so we can have menus and different levels, and the new sample level that's loading seems to be working OK. I can select and move units again, and when I move them near an enemy he comes over and gives my guys a hug and they all pixel stack. It's cute." |
| **Sunday, 2:38 AM** | "Starting to wonder how to make this into an actual game that's fun to play... I think the first thing is that combat underlying mechanics seem to be working since I see health points changing on the selection UI, and I can kill the enemy in the tutorial and win. But I'm not seeing any of the animations we tried to add." |
| **10:46 AM** | "I can't really vibe anymore. Well I'm still not writing code, but I'm down to one feature at a time, really having to understand what each module does, that division of responsibilities, so I know where to add things and debug." |
| **5:00 PM** | "Oooh I'm kinda running out of time. I need to do real work on Monday. I have Manus working on extending the graphics and doing some procedural map generation, Claude code fixing a bug, and Claude web UI in the front where I'm going to start ideating on making this something playable." |
| **6:00 PM** | Working with Manus.ai to add procedurally generated maps and new assets. Focusing on exploration scenario without player-created buildings or resource gathering. |
| **7:08 PM** | "Wow look how much junk is on this playfield lol. Also... it built walls but ya can just walk right through them. Also... the styling is a little out of this world." <br><br> "Objectives kinda work. Combat kinda works but is very boring and still can't see HP of our own units except for the big display on the side." |
| **7:18 PM** | Working on adding fog of war functionality. |
| **Monday, 7:34 PM** | "I would kinda like to put enough lipstick on this pig to submit." <br><br> Discovering issues with map navigation and invisible obstacles. |
| **Tuesday, 1:00 AM** | "NGL I'm tired of vibe coding lol. It's a very specific kind of work, integrating stuff into an existing codebase, and I'm tired of doing that very specific kind of work. I want to spend time on the creative stuff, worldbuilding and writing but... it is 1 am, if I want to submit this thing I need to iron out the last few bugs / features keeping it from being playable." |
| **Tuesday, 7:35 AM** | Aaahhhh I'm so annoyed, I got everything deployed and it works except nginx will not serve wav files despite... some sleepy quarter brain attempts to get it to work. However I'm out of time. Publishing it and calling it... |
| **...** | Is it janky? Yes. Did I learn a crapload about (i) AI assisted coding and (ii) game engine internals? Yes. But more importantly it makes me realize that tiny games like this are possible for me - I've been wanting to tell multimodal sometimes-interactive stories and have dreamed about being able to add something like this that's specifically exactly mine and part of my world/story and... now I can. |
| **...** | In the end I think I probably paid $20 in Claude Code API costs on this project, and a lot of that is the cost of being lazy, like dropping an entire response from Claude Web UI into 'CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md' and telling Claude Code to integrate everything while I go do something else. At least $5 of that is the tool 'solving the issue' and fucking things up instead. And then towards the end, relatively simple queries could easily cost $2 by themselves because the files are SO huge and there's SO many tokens going into context.|
| **...** | I used Manus a couple times, trying to break out work packages to him while I worked on something else. It wasn't bad work, it got a lot of the structure code for the game engine done, and a graphics redesign (most of the crazy stuff on the playfield was designed by Manus) but it still took a bunch of time and effort to see 'OK what files did he update / change / create', download them all, get all the code in the right place, finding runtime bugs and having to fix those anyway. So it's just a lot of integration work either way. |
| **...** | Got lazy with testing, particularly when I realized the LM wrote at least one bullshit test, and then once that was in the codebase it wrote lots more bullshit tests and starting to do things just to make tests pass without meaningful challenge. However, now there are a shitload of integration bugs where things just aren't hooked up correctly soooo... it was a choice. |
| **...** | There are also layers of old crufty code and hacks from debugging that are painful to look at. The fog of war system is a disaster. Unit types are so confusing that I paid $0.85 to Claude Code last night to explain to me where to find the health / armor adjustments. And there's a TON of (lets add this thing while we're at it) that never got used, and I don't know what is or is not in use. |
| **...** | Conclusion: This was a blast but... gods... is this our future? AIs do the bulk processing of text (code, or in my case, huge sets of requirements / design documentation / risk documentation) while humans just kinda do the integration work? When eventually it truly doesn't make sense for a human to do that critical thinking level work because the AI is *just* better at it? That freaking sucks man. This mindless integration work is *truly* work, where the only joy comes from being able to think and work at the level of features. But we can't ONLY think at the level of features yet, and this middle ground is exhausting for someone who loves the puzzle aspect of coding. |
